# Cmod Modularity Framework

*by Tyler Troyer*

Welcome to the Cmod Manual! This guide is the primary reference for the Cmod Modularity Framework.

Cmod is a collection of Python classes that simplify project structuring and testing for C projects. The Cmod Modularity Framework is especially suited for test-driven development and embedded systems.

Add Cmod to your project and see how *managed C modules* invite cleaner code and enable simplified test-driven development for small projects and large development teams alike.
