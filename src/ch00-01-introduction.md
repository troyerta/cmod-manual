# Introduction

Welcome to the Cmod guide - the primary reference for the Cmod Modularity Framework. Cmod helps you write more reliable software.

The unique challenges of embedded software development can obscure the pathway to carefully structured software with standards, style, and tests. This is especially common in cross-compiled C applications for embedded systems.

While the reasons for this may be arguable, Cmod challenges the excuses for the prevalency of this phenomenon, and invites code quality into the house - quietly, through the window gaps and cracks in the bricks.

Cmod is a C module modularity framework that enables clean project structure and testable modules.

### What is a modularity framework?
In this development framework, C modules are first class citizens - not your tests, not your platform code, not your host OS.

Modular code wins the benefits of consistency, strong structure, clean interfaces, and testability.

- A set of tools that enable, encourage, and enforce the modularity of your code before anything else
- Cmod tools make this easy, and further enable these benefits with it's code generator, formatter, and module addresser
- Enables easy templating - allowing development to focus on tests and application code - speed up your code reviews


### Why do we need one?
- Because currently available "Test Frameworks" fall short in these ways:
Embedded systems projects have special needs, but that's no excuse for treating your codebase
like the wild west.

- Cmod stores your project preferences so they can be applied over and over again.

- Because good project structure should come before adding tests
- Because testability and modularity feed each other
- Because Cmod is lightweight, and doesn't impose bad ideas onto your projects
- Because good tests can be decoupled from the test harness, and the execution environment
- Because modularity forces you to formalize your object scope, and module interfaces/interactions
