# Introduction

Welcome to the Cmod guide - the primary reference for the Cmod Modularity Framework. Cmod helps you write more manageable software.

Managed Software is:
- Complete: Consistently includes all the resources needed for maintenance and testing for each and every component.

- Organized: Consistently arranged in a methodical, clearly defined pattern, facilitating scalability and predictable us of development resources.

- Modular: Loosely couple components can be transparently interchanged through the use of clearly defined interfaces and abstractions that free the application from the back end implementation.

These project attributes are very difficult to bring to fruition in practice, but Cmod challenges the traditional excuses for poorly organized projects.

Cmod is a C modularity framework that enables clean project structure and testable modules.

### What is a modularity framework?
A modularity framework is just a development framework (or facilitated development pattern) where C modules are first class citizens. Modular code wins the benefits of consistency, strong structure, clean interfaces, and testability.
